# Comprehending commands
This module is for some basic but very important commands used in Linux environment
<br><br><br>

## Challenge-1 Cat: not the pet, but the command!
`cat` command is one of the most used command used in linux , used to read files.

When given multiple arguments, cat command will concatenate the files and present them as one line at a time

So for the challenge I just added the ~/ directory before the flag file with cat command `cat ~/flag`

Flag:- `pwn.college{UtMZtvrT2k5lVx1VNOSz4d0Rbvw.dFzN1QDL0MTO0czW}`
<br><br>

## Challenge-2 catting absolute paths
Here we searching for the file in the absolute directory rather than jut hoping it already exists in our currently positioned home directory

`cat \file` is the command

Flag `pwn.college{0wHVQ7ryo5CBhFfK0mCrBuSK7Hb.dlTM5QDL0MTO0czW}`

## Challenge-1 Learing from Documentation
This challenge gives us a basic idea of reading ocumentation acan help us find the right specifications of our commands.

With the `/challenge/challenge` as the command the given documentation tells us `--giveflag` is the right argument

So using that, I get the flag
flag `pwn.college{ooFZDIDnfLWrHYxEXpiWrf53Z4J.dRjM5QDL0MTO0czW}`
<br><br>

## Challenge-2 Complex Usage
This challenge gives us an idea of how in some documentations we have information about commands which have aguments for arguements

So following the Documentation
`/challenge/challenge --printfile /flag` to get the flag
flag `pwn.college{wWnBNeOLsh43sMsudClT99aiJBT.dVjM5QDL0MTO0czW}`

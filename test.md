# Hello Hackers Writeup
This is gonna be my first write up for the cryptonie taskphase. Hope I don't mess this up.



## Challenge 1- Intro to commnads
This one is easy a all I had to do open the wsl terminal, sync my pwn and use the command `hello`.
The flag i got was this
`pwn.college{8szx1G-atJVnT-FDLeuabGcsSb-.ddjNyUDL0MTO0czW}`


## Challenge 2-  Intro to Arguments
Here we understand that a command in the terminal can be added with an aditional argument
So for example with the command `echo` you can add any argument you want your terminal to show

Here i added the command `hello` with the argument `hackers` and got the key
`pwn.college{kBzzEsgsDrOfOQ_pl8KWw_1gI5C.dhjNyUDL0MTO0czW}`
